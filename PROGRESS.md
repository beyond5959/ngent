# Progress

## Project Overview

Ngent Server is a Go service that exposes HTTP/JSON APIs and SSE streaming for multi-client, multi-thread agent turns.
The system targets ACP-compatible agent providers, lazily resolves per-thread/session-scope providers, persists interaction history in SQLite, and bridges runtime permission requests back to clients.
Current built-in providers are `codex`, `claude`, `cursor`, `opencode`, `gemini`, `kimi`, `qwen`, and `blackbox`.
This file is the source of milestone progress, validation commands, and next actions.

## Current Milestone

- `Post-M8` ACP multi-agent readiness and maintenance.

## Latest Update (2026-04-04)

- `Post-M8` memory-file consistency audit completed:
  - updated `docs/SPEC.md` current-state sections to match the real code paths, storage model, and HTTP surface, and moved older rollout notes into an appendix instead of leaving them as conflicting numbered spec sections.
  - corrected `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR drift by removing the dangling ADR-021 index entry, marking superseded/current client-id and bind decisions accurately, and reassigning duplicated later rollout ADR ids to unique canonical ids.
  - cleaned `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` bookkeeping by making per-entry status authoritative, fixing duplicated issue ids, and updating KI-032 to reflect the current no-background-refresh model-catalog behavior.
  - refreshed `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` requirement 31 to match append-only event storage plus read-time history compaction, including the current storage-test name.
  - deduplicated repeated `2026-03-26` progress notes and corrected the project overview to describe per-thread/session-scope provider caching.
  - validation:
    - pass: `git diff --check`
    - pass: doc consistency audits for ADR ids, KI ids, and acceptance-referenced test names against the current repository tree

## Previous Update (2026-04-04)

- `Post-M8` Web UI git-diff drawer stability fix completed:
  - opening a changed file in the git-diff chip no longer installs outside-click or focus-leave auto-dismiss behavior, so the right-side drawer stays open during normal workspace interaction instead of collapsing on the next arbitrary click.
  - the open drawer now renders from a browser-local preview snapshot keyed by thread session, while `/v1/threads/{threadId}/git-diff` polling continues to refresh only the chip and file list.
  - keeping the drawer off the poll-driven re-render path prevents forced detail reloads, DOM replacement flicker, and scroll/content jumping while the same file preview is open.
  - follow-up fix: collapsing the git-diff chip no longer closes the right-side drawer; the drawer is now dismissed only by its own close button.
  - follow-up fix: clicking a file row now always refetches that file's detail from the backend instead of reusing the prior open's cached drawer payload.
  - follow-up polish: the drawer content rows no longer render horizontal separators, and the diff/content typography now matches the composer footer's model-label styling.
  - follow-up fix: the drawer's `<code>` content now explicitly inherits that model-label font family instead of falling back to the browser's default code font.
  - follow-up polish: the drawer content rows now use tighter line-height and vertical padding so each row is shorter without reducing text size.
  - follow-up fix: tracked diff previews now derive real old/new line numbers from each hunk header, show both line-number columns in the drawer, keep hunk headers visible without numbers, and hide raw diff header metadata such as `diff --git` / `index` / `---` / `+++`.
  - follow-up API compaction: `/v1/threads/{threadId}/git-diff-file` now returns grouped rendered `blocks[]` instead of duplicating raw `content` plus per-line `lines[]`; adjacent same-tone rows are merged into one block carrying `text[]` and only the relevant `oldLineNumbers[]` / `newLineNumbers[]`.
  - follow-up simplification: the Web UI now renders those server-produced blocks directly and infers whether old/new line-number columns should appear from the presence of the corresponding number arrays, so the old `showLineNumbers` flag is gone.
  - performance note: the structured diff blocks are still produced server-side in one linear scan over the already loaded file/diff text, without introducing extra git subprocess calls per request.
  - session-scoped preview snapshots are preserved separately per selected session, so switching sessions hides unrelated previews and returning to the prior session restores that session's last opened drawer content.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

## Previous Update (2026-04-03)

- `Post-M8` Web UI git-diff per-file preview drawer completed:
  - added `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/git-diff-file?path=...`, backed by `internal/gitutil.FileDetail`, so the server can return per-file preview payloads for the currently visible working-tree diff.
  - tracked text changes now load raw patch content from `git --no-pager diff -- <path>`, while untracked text files return their current file contents directly; binary/non-text files are marked non-viewable instead of opening a broken preview.
  - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/git-diff` file rows now also expose `viewable`, allowing the embedded SPA to disable unsupported rows up front.
  - the embedded Web UI git-diff chip still expands to the changed-file list, but clicking a viewable row now opens a right-side slide-out drawer over the chat pane, with close affordance, per-line diff/content rendering, and same-session file switching without leaving the current conversation.
  - follow-up polish: untracked binary rows now still show the existing `New` badge while remaining disabled, and the drawer keeps its selection/browser-local open state scoped to the active thread session instead of leaking into backend state.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

## Previous Update (2026-04-03)

- `Post-M8` grouped thread-session collapse affordance completed:
  - the embedded Web UI grouped left rail now lets each thread collapse or expand its own inline session list without affecting other threads.
  - the leading agent glyph now doubles as the collapse toggle:
    - expanded groups keep the provider avatar at rest and switch to a down-chevron affordance on hover/focus.
    - collapsed groups keep a right-chevron visible so hidden sessions remain discoverable.
  - toggling collapse preserves the existing thread activation flow, overflow menu, and `New session` action; starting a new session auto-expands that thread again so the fresh session row can appear immediately.
  - no backend/API/runtime behavior changed; this is a browser-local Web UI interaction update layered on top of the existing grouped rail.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

## Previous Update (2026-04-03)

- `Post-M8` cross-client active session spinner visibility completed:
  - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/sessions` now decorates each returned session row with `isActive` when that concrete `(thread, session)` scope currently owns a live turn.
  - the response still prepends the thread's currently bound `sessionId`, so even if the upstream provider session catalog is stale, a newly opened browser can still see the active session row and its loading spinner.
  - the embedded Web UI now merges server-reported `session.isActive` with its existing local in-browser `streamStates`, so the grouped left rail shows the same spinner both for turns started in the current browser and for sessions another browser opens while already active.
  - targeted HTTP coverage now verifies that a second client querying `/sessions` during a running bound-session turn sees `isActive=true` on the active session row and that the flag clears again after completion.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

## Previous Update (2026-04-03)

- `Post-M8` Web UI merged thread/session left rail completed:
  - removed the dedicated middle session drawer and its chat-edge collapse toggle; the workspace now uses one left navigation column plus the main chat area.
  - the left rail now renders each thread as a grouped header with its ACP session rows directly underneath, closer to Codex App's project/session browsing model while preserving the existing thread-based backend model.
  - session switching now activates the clicked thread and selected session in one step, so choosing a historical session from another thread opens the correct transcript immediately instead of briefly rendering that thread's default session first.
  - each thread group now shows at most 5 sessions at first render; `Show more` expands the next chunk and still honors backend `nextCursor` pagination when additional provider pages exist.
  - per-thread `New session`, refresh, loading indicators, session-title live updates, and post-turn session-list refresh behavior were all retained inside the merged grouped rail.
  - follow-up polish: thread headers no longer show relative timestamps or any selected/highlighted state; only session rows carry selection styling.
  - follow-up polish: session refresh moved out of the inline header controls into the thread three-dot overflow menu, and the grouped thread header now uses the agent/provider icon as its leading visual instead of a generic folder glyph.
  - follow-up polish: thread-group hover/background feedback was removed so only session rows react on hover, thread-header actions now stay visible without hover reveal, and inter-group spacing was tightened so the rail reads as one continuous list.
  - follow-up polish: the thread overflow trigger is now permanently visible like `New session`, active session rows use a stronger accent treatment for clearer selection, and the rail side padding was reduced so content sits closer to the panel edge.
  - follow-up polish: thread-header overflow buttons now react only to direct button hover instead of inheriting whole-row hover feedback, the rail padding/indent was tightened again, thread headers no longer show a streaming spinner for active sessions, and the active-session left accent line was softened.
  - follow-up polish: the old chat-edge collapse handle pattern that previously controlled the session drawer now controls the merged threads rail, so the left thread/session panel can collapse and expand with the same hover-reveal affordance.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

## Previous Update (2026-04-03)

- `Post-M8` Web UI live-plan bottom overlay completed:
  - ACP `sessionUpdate:"plan"` updates no longer render inside the assistant transcript bubble or finalized history message.
  - the embedded Web UI now renders the current running turn's latest plan as an ephemeral bottom-floating card anchored above the chat input, so users can track step progress without scrolling back to the top of a long reply.
  - the floating card is hydrated from the same persisted `plan_update` turn events already used for running-turn recovery, so a refreshed browser or another browser entering the same active session sees the current live plan and continues receiving updates through the resumed per-turn SSE stream.
  - when the turn completes, errors, or disconnect-finalizes, the live plan card disappears together with the turn's streaming-only runtime state instead of remaining in transcript history.
  - the message list now reserves dynamic bottom inset space while the live plan card is visible, preventing the floating card from covering the latest transcript content or the scroll-to-bottom button.
  - follow-up fix: history cache hydration no longer reattaches stale `planEntries` from already-rendered in-memory messages, which previously could resurrect the old top-of-message plan block after session switches or history reloads.

## Previous Update (2026-04-02)

- `Post-M8` session-scoped Web UI git diff summary and file-change panel completed:
  - added `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/git-diff`, backed by `internal/gitutil`, which parses `git --no-pager diff --shortstat`, `git --no-pager diff --numstat`, and untracked file paths from `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -z` for the thread working tree.
  - the endpoint is fail-soft like the existing git branch API:
    - if `git` is unavailable, it returns `available=false`.
    - if the thread `cwd` is not inside a git repository, it returns `available=false`.
  - the embedded Web UI now polls this endpoint every 15 seconds only when the active thread has a selected concrete session id, immediately refetches when the user switches sessions, and refreshes again after turn completion, but the API itself no longer requires or echoes `sessionId`.
  - when tracked or untracked working-tree changes exist, the composer now shows a Kimi-style change-summary chip above the input; expanding it reveals the per-file rows and repository root, and untracked files render with a dedicated "New" badge.
  - follow-up fix: the Web UI now preserves the backend `untracked` flag during API normalization, so untracked rows actually render as the dedicated "New" badge instead of falling back to "Changed".
  - follow-up fix: the chip now tracks pending self-toggles separately from polled diff data, so the trigger's own `focusout` during DOM re-render no longer reopens the panel and repeated real clicks open/close it immediately.
  - follow-up polish: expanded git-diff file rows now show suffix/file-name based type icons sourced from a locally vendored subset of `file-icons/vscode` font assets, with theme-aware tinted icon tiles and a generic fallback for unknown file types.
  - clean repositories, non-git directories, and hosts without `git` show no diff chip at all.

## Previous Update (2026-04-01)

- `Post-M8` Web UI Spanish/French localization and multilingual README expansion completed:
  - expanded the embedded Web UI `language` preference from two values to four: `en`, `zh-CN`, `es`, and `fr`.
  - browser-locale detection now maps the closest supported locale on first load:
    - `zh-*` browsers default to `zh-CN`.
    - `es-*` browsers default to `es`.
    - `fr-*` browsers default to `fr`.
    - all other locales default to `en`.
  - localized the client-owned SPA chrome and relative-time labels for Spanish and French, and added Settings language switches for all four supported UI languages.
  - added root `README.es.md` and `README.fr.md`, and cross-linked all root README variants so the repository landing docs are available in four languages.

## Previous Update (2026-04-01)

- `Post-M8` active-turn viewer disconnect decoupling and resumable shared live SSE completed:
  - server-side turn execution is no longer tied to the lifetime of the original `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/turns` response, so browser refreshes and other viewer disconnects no longer cancel a healthy in-flight turn unless the user explicitly requests cancel.
  - added `GET /v1/turns/{turnId}/events?after=<seq>` so a refreshed browser or a second browser can replay persisted turn events and then tail the same live turn stream from the last seen per-turn sequence.
  - permission decisions now emit persisted/live `permission_resolved` turn events, so one browser approving a request updates the other browsers watching the same active turn instead of leaving stale pending cards behind.
  - restored turn-event persistence to true append-only-on-write semantics, which keeps per-turn `seq` ordering stable for safe live resume while leaving any delta coalescing to read-time history serialization only.
  - thread list/get responses now expose `hasActiveSession`, so a newly opened browser can immediately see which agent/thread currently owns a live session before opening that conversation.
  - the embedded Web UI now rehydrates running turns from persisted events on history load, restores the active session/live bubble/pending permissions after refresh, consumes `permission_resolved`, fixes streaming-bubble dedupe during running-turn hydration, and reconnects transport-level viewer drops without converting them into user-visible turn cancellation.

## Previous Update (2026-04-01)

- `Post-M8` Web UI Simplified Chinese localization and Settings language switch completed:
  - added a browser-local persisted `language` preference to the embedded Vite + TypeScript SPA, alongside the existing theme/auth/server settings.
  - first load now defaults to the closest supported browser locale:
    - `zh-*` browsers default to `zh-CN`.
    - all other locales default to `en`.
  - moved language switching into the Settings drawer and wired root-shell re-rendering so changing language updates the sidebar, session rail, composer, empty states, permission cards, markdown controls, and other primary UI chrome immediately.
  - localized client-owned Web UI strings and relative-time labels for English + Simplified Chinese while keeping provider/server payload text as-is.

## Previous Update (2026-03-30)

- `Post-M8` ACP session-usage persistence and Web UI context-pressure indicator completed:
  - added shared ACP session-usage handling for both `session/update {sessionUpdate:"usage_update"}` and cumulative prompt-response `usage` payloads, including embedded Codex/Claude flows and shared ACP CLI drivers.
  - persisted per-session usage snapshots in sqlite `session_usage_cache`, keyed by `(agent_id, cwd, session_id)` and merged with `COALESCE` semantics so partial provider updates can accumulate over time instead of overwriting earlier fields with nulls.
  - added `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/session-usage?sessionId=...` plus streamed/persisted `session_usage_update` turn events, so both the browser and later tooling can re-query usage after the original turn is gone.
  - the embedded Web UI now listens for live `session_usage_update`, loads cached usage when a session is opened, and renders a small ring-only circular progress badge at the composer footer bottom-right to the right of the git branch pill.
  - the badge is intentionally fail-soft:
    - if a provider never returns usage, the Web UI shows nothing.
    - if a provider returns token totals but no context-window `used/size`, the data is still cached in sqlite but the Web UI stays hidden because no safe percentage can be computed.

## Previous Update (2026-03-30)

- `Post-M8` Web UI git-branch footer and checkout switcher completed:
  - added thread-scoped git inspection/switch support through new `GET/POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/git` endpoints backed by `internal/gitutil`.
  - the backend now treats branch checkout as a thread-wide shared-state mutation: if any session on the thread is actively streaming, branch switching returns `409 CONFLICT`.
  - missing `git` binaries and non-repository working directories are handled as optional capability absence, so the API returns `available=false` and the frontend hides the control instead of surfacing a hard error.
  - the embedded Web UI composer now shows a Codex-style branch pill at the bottom-right only when the active thread's `cwd` is inside a local git repository; expanding it reveals local branches and clicking a branch checks it out immediately.
  - after each turn settles, the Web UI refreshes git state so agent-driven branch changes are reflected without requiring a full page reload.

## Earlier Update (2026-03-30)

- `Post-M8` restrained desktop-workbench Web UI redesign completed:
  - Phase 0 baseline completed:
    - reviewed the embedded SPA implementation and captured before screenshots for the home empty state, `New Agent` modal, and chat workspace.
  - Phase 1-2 visual foundation and shell completed:
    - replaced the earlier glassy/ascii-branded presentation with a denser desktop-tool direction built on cooler neutral surfaces, restrained blue emphasis, tighter radii, flatter shadows, and a local/system font stack.
    - removed decorative background treatments and rebuilt the shell so the main chat workspace is visually primary while the left rails recede.
    - redesigned the no-thread workspace into an anchored workbench overview panel with one primary action instead of a large floating empty state.
  - Phase 3-5 navigation, creation flow, and composer completed:
    - converted thread and session browsing into more compact tool-style lists with lighter hover feedback and a restrained active-state marker instead of card-like highlight blocks.
    - rebuilt the `New Agent` modal around a working-directory-first flow; agent selection now reads like a mature runtime picker and advanced JSON options are visually demoted.
    - compressed the chat header hierarchy and turned the composer into a cleaner editor-like control surface with secondary model/reasoning controls and a flatter send action.
  - Phase 6-7 message system, dark mode, and responsive refinement completed:
    - unified assistant content, reasoning, plan, tool calls, markdown blocks, and permission review under one document-like section language rather than unrelated plugin-card styles.
    - tuned dark mode independently instead of relying on a simple inversion, and kept the mobile layout structurally coherent when the side rails collapse.
  - behavior compatibility:
    - kept the existing no-framework Vite + TypeScript SPA architecture, HTTP/JSON API usage, POST SSE stream path, `activeStreamMsgId` sentinel semantics, history-load guards, permission workflow, `bindMarkdownControls(...)` calls, and existing thread/session/input/cancel bindings intact.

## Previous Update (2026-03-27)

- `Post-M8` shared-browser thread/session visibility completed:
  - changed thread list/get/update/delete and other thread-scoped APIs to resolve threads globally by `threadId` instead of requiring the creating browser's `X-Client-ID`.
  - stopped binding runtime permission decisions and persisted attachment fetches to the original browser-local `clientId`, so another browser can continue the same thread and open the same uploads.
  - removed the obsolete sqlite `threads.client_id` field and dropped the old `clients` table; `X-Client-ID` remains only as a required compatibility header and is no longer persisted.
  - changed recent-directory suggestions to use one global recency list instead of browser-scoped filtering.
  - updated the Web UI attachment URL builder to stop sending `client_id` on `/attachments/*`.
  - removed the Web UI's visible Client ID settings entirely; the browser now sends one fixed compatibility `X-Client-ID` header internally instead of exposing per-browser identity controls.

## Previous Update (2026-03-26)

- `Post-M8` Web UI fresh-session binding/render preservation fix completed:
  - when a fresh session receives `session_bound`, the left session panel now upserts that bound `sessionId` immediately and forces a panel refresh instead of waiting for the first turn to finish and refresh session history.
  - session-panel dedupe now preserves richer later metadata (`title`, `cwd`, `updatedAt`) for duplicate session ids, so temporary placeholders do not block later server-provided session details.
  - history reload now recognizes fresh-session scope promotion into a bound session and reuses the in-memory message cache for that first replay pass, preventing immediate transcript/history refresh from stripping streamed `thinking` / `tool_call` sections off the just-finished first reply.
  - full-page refresh is also preserved now: when transcript replay overlaps with persisted turn history, the Web UI rehydrates the replayed messages from the richer event-backed local turn reconstruction so `reasoning` / `tool_call` sections survive reload.
  - backend `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/sessions` now also prepends the thread's currently bound `sessionId`, so the active session remains visible even when the upstream provider `session/list` result is stale or has not surfaced that new session yet.

- `Post-M8` initial Web UI visual refresh completed (later superseded by the 2026-03-30 desktop-workbench redesign):
  - kept the existing no-framework SPA data flow, SSE behavior, store semantics, and API contracts unchanged; the change set is UI-only.
  - refreshed the shell, navigation, composer, overlays, and permission surfaces as an earlier quality pass before the later restrained workbench redesign.
  - upgraded interaction polish across thread rows, session cards, slash-command popover, settings drawer, new-agent modal, permission cards, and attachment chips.
  - updated the visual token system while keeping light/dark themes and responsive behavior intact.
  - follow-up: reduced the chat-header session title size on both desktop and narrow/mobile breakpoints so long titles feel less heavy and consume less vertical attention.
  - follow-up: switched sidebar/chat provider avatars from inline `<img>` tags to CSS background-image icons so session switches and `New session` resets no longer trigger repeat icon fetches for Codex avatars.

- `Post-M8` Web UI user-message base64 image placeholder rendering completed:
  - user prompt bubbles now detect inline placeholders that start with `[Image: data:image/...;base64,...]` and render them as immediate inline image previews instead of raw base64 text.
  - the parser is fail-soft and image-only: it accepts only `data:image/*;base64,...` payloads, strips incidental whitespace inside the data URL, and falls back to ordinary markdown rendering for malformed or non-image placeholders.
  - ordinary user markdown/text rendering remains unchanged around those placeholders, and the message copy action still preserves the original raw message text.

## Previous Update (2026-03-23)

- `Post-M8` human-readable stderr logger rollout completed:
  - replaced the previous `slog` JSON logger with a repo-local leveled logger in `internal/observability`, keeping the existing `Debug/Info/Warn/Error` call shape while switching output to readable text lines on `stderr`.
  - changed HTTP request completion logs to a compact nginx-style access-log format such as `INFO: 2026-03-23 15:30:45 127.0.0.1 - "GET /v1/threads HTTP/1.1" 200 OK 12.4ms`.
  - kept ACP `--debug` tracing and secret redaction intact; debug traces now render as readable text with sanitized embedded JSON payloads instead of JSON log envelopes.
  - enabled ANSI color for level/status segments only when `stderr` is a TTY, so redirected output remains plain text.

- `Post-M8` Cursor CLI ACP integration completed:
  - added `internal/agents/cursor` on top of the shared `acpcli` driver, with startup fallback across `agent acp` and `cursor-agent acp`.
  - wired `cursor` into startup preflight, `/v1/agents`, thread allowlist, turn factory, and agent-model discovery flow.
  - verified against the local installed Cursor CLI and the official ACP docs that Cursor requires an ACP `authenticate` call with `methodId="cursor_login"` after `initialize`; without that step, real `session/new` does not respond.
  - confirmed by local probing that Cursor model selection is exposed through ACP `configOptions` and must be applied via `session/set_config_option("model", ...)`; `session/new.model` and `session/new.modelId` are ignored by the real CLI.
  - normalized generic ACP permission-option matching so providers advertising hyphenated kinds such as `allow-once` / `reject-once` still flow through ngent's fail-closed default decision path.
  - added fake-process coverage for:
    - authenticated ACP stream startup.
    - model selection through `session/set_config_option`.
    - model discovery after ACP authentication.
    - session transcript replay after ACP authentication.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/cursor ./internal/agents/acpcli ./cmd/ngent`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

## Previous Update (2026-03-22)

- `Post-M8` ACP assistant image/resource content rendering completed:
  - extended shared ACP `agent_message_chunk` parsing so non-text assistant payloads are preserved as structured content blocks instead of being dropped when they are not `{type:"text",text:...}` deltas.
  - added a first-class assistant message-content callback in the agent layer and bridged those blocks through HTTP/SSE/history as `message_content` events alongside the existing `message_delta` text stream.
  - updated the Web UI assistant segment timeline to render `message_content` blocks during streaming and after reload/history reconstruction, with dedicated cards for image content and embedded resource content plus JSON fallback for unknown block shapes.
  - kept `responseText` as the visible-text aggregate only, so existing API consumers remain compatible while structured content survives in turn events.

- `Post-M8` BLACKBOX Web UI tool-call rendering normalization completed:
  - dropped standalone whitespace-only assistant chunks when they arrive as isolated separators around tool calls, preventing BLACKBOX turns from rendering large blank answer blocks or effectively empty assistant messages.
  - widened Web UI tool-call payload handling so `content` / `locations` no longer require array-only shapes; single-object payloads are normalized and still rendered.
  - improved tool-call titles for generic BLACKBOX payloads such as search calls titled only `.` by falling back to kind/path-derived labels.

- `Post-M8` BLACKBOX AI ACP integration completed:
  - added `internal/agents/blackbox` on top of the shared `acpcli` driver, using `blackbox --experimental-acp` with stdout-noise tolerance because the CLI can emit non-JSON process/telemetry lines before or between ACP frames.
  - wired `blackbox` into startup preflight, `/v1/agents`, thread allowlist, turn factory, and agent-model discovery flow.
  - confirmed against local `blackbox 1.2.47` ACP probing that:
    - `initialize` and `session/new` succeed with the standard ACP handshake.
    - current initialize capabilities advertise `loadSession=false`.
    - real `session/load` returns `-32601 method not found`, so existing-session replay and session sidebar resume remain unavailable for now.
    - ACP startup itself does not require explicitly passing `BLACKBOX_API_KEY` as long as the local BLACKBOX CLI already has a usable auth method configured; actual prompt execution still depends on valid upstream auth/network state.
  - added fake-process coverage for:
    - streaming with noisy stdout.
    - model forwarding through startup args plus ACP `session/new` / `session/prompt`.
    - fail-closed structured permission bridging.
    - unsupported `session/list` behavior when `loadSession=false`.

- `Post-M8` Web UI agent-list overflow trigger hover-only reveal completed:
  - changed the agent-list three-dot trigger to stay hidden by default and reveal only on row hover, keyboard focus, or while its menu is open.
  - increased the trigger size slightly while keeping its hover surface compact, so the control is easier to hit once revealed without dominating the action column.
  - validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `env GOCACHE=/tmp/ngent-gocache GOFLAGS=-p=1 /usr/local/go/bin/go test ./...`

## Previous Update (2026-03-19)

- `Post-M8` Web UI left-rail layout alignment completed:
  - kept the agent/thread rail permanently expanded after follow-up product review; only the session panel now supports collapse/expand.
  - removed the agent-list search box and its keyboard shortcut/filtering path; the left rail is now a straight thread list with actions only.
  - moved `New agent` below the agent list and updated the expanded session header to show the active agent name, project path, and a full-width `New session` entry above the session list.
  - removed the redundant uppercase `SESSIONS` section label above the session list after the new header/new-session block, keeping the panel header visually quieter.
  - restored the left-top brand label from `Agents` to the product name `Ngent`.
  - hid the session panel entirely until an agent/thread is selected, so first load no longer reserves a blank middle column.
  - fixed the CSS visibility rule so the hidden session panel truly leaves the flex layout instead of still occupying width via `.session-sidebar { display:flex }`.
  - flattened the expanded session panel surface so its header and list share the same background plane instead of reading as two differently colored sections.

## Earlier Update (2026-03-16)

- `Post-M8` ACP tool-call streaming completed:
  - extended shared ACP `session/update` parsing to preserve structured `tool_call` and `tool_call_update` payloads, including `toolCallId`, status/title/kind, content blocks, locations, and raw input/output payloads.
  - added first-class turn callbacks plus HTTP/SSE/history persistence for those tool-call events instead of dropping them at the provider boundary.
  - updated the Web UI stream state and history reconstruction to merge tool-call events by `toolCallId` and render live/persisted tool-call cards alongside plan/reasoning/message output.

- `Post-M8` Web UI fresh-session reset fix completed:
  - explicit `New session` now allocates a client-side fresh-session scope even when the active thread already has no persisted `sessionId`, so repeated `New session` clicks no longer reuse the same anonymous chat buffer.
  - empty-session history replay now drops cancelled turns that never emitted `session_bound` and never produced visible response text, preventing stale cancelled placeholders from reappearing after reload.

- `Post-M8` deferred thread config apply completed:
  - changed `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` to validate against available config options and persist thread `agentOptions.modelId` / `agentOptions.configOverrides` without mutating the live provider.
  - narrowed cached provider scope from full `agentOptions` to thread + session/fresh-session identity, so picker edits no longer evict the current session provider by themselves.
  - added turn-start config sync: right before streaming a new turn, ngent compares persisted thread selections against the cached provider's current model/reasoning state and only then applies changed options.
  - updated acceptance/spec/ADR docs to describe the new "persist now, apply on next turn" behavior.

## Previous Update (2026-03-14)

- `Post-M8` Web UI thinking tense alignment completed:
  - kept the live reasoning toggle label as `Thinking` while deltas are still streaming.
  - switched finalized reasoning labels to `Thought` so completed content reads in the past tense.

- `Post-M8` Web UI thinking markdown rendering completed:
  - switched finalized `Thinking` content from escaped plain text to the same sanitized markdown renderer used by finalized assistant replies.
  - kept streaming reasoning as plain text so partial markdown does not reflow while deltas are still arriving.
  - extended markdown typography/code styles to apply inside expanded `Thinking` content as well as normal assistant message bubbles.

- `Post-M8` Web UI thinking fold UX completed:
  - changed the `Thinking` section to a native collapsible panel in the Web UI.
  - keep in-flight reasoning panels expanded while `reasoning_delta` is still streaming.
  - once the turn settles into persisted history, render the same `Thinking` content collapsed by default so final replies stay compact.
  - preserve manual expand/collapse state for finalized messages across in-page list re-renders.

- `Post-M8` Web UI thinking/reasoning visibility completed:
  - added a per-turn reasoning callback bridge in `internal/agents` so ACP `thought_message_chunk` / `agent_thought_chunk` updates no longer stop at provider parsing.
  - persisted hidden reasoning as first-class `reasoning_delta` turn events in the HTTP/SSE layer, alongside existing `message_delta` and `plan_update` events.
  - updated the Web UI stream state and history reconstruction so agent messages render a visible `Thinking` section during streaming and after reload/history fetch.
  - kept assistant answer text as `responseText`; reasoning remains event-backed instead of being merged into the visible answer body.
  - added regression coverage for:
    - ACP notification routing of thought chunks into reasoning callbacks.
    - SSE/history persistence of `reasoning_delta` events.

## Previous Update (2026-03-13)

- `Post-M8` shared ACP CLI provider driver completed:
  - extracted `internal/agents/acpcli` as the shared ACP CLI lifecycle driver for `qwen`, `opencode`, `gemini`, and `kimi`, covering shared `initialize/session/new/session/load/session/list/session/prompt/session/set_config_option` flow plus model discovery and transcript replay.
  - migrated the four ACP CLI providers to provider-hook configuration instead of maintaining separate copies of the same stdio/session orchestration logic.
  - extended `internal/agents/acpstdio` with opt-in stdout-noise tolerance so Gemini can reuse the same transport instead of a provider-local JSON-RPC implementation.
  - preserved provider-specific behavior behind hooks:
    - `gemini` keeps temporary `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` bootstrapping and stdout noise filtering.
    - `qwen` / `kimi` keep selectable permission-option mapping and fail-closed timeout handling.
    - `opencode` keeps synchronous `session/cancel` behavior.
    - pass: real host smoke `E2E_QWEN=1 go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run TestQwenE2ESmoke -count=1 -v -timeout 180s`
    - pass: real host replay `E2E_QWEN=1 go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run TestQwenE2ESessionTranscriptReplay -count=1 -v -timeout 240s`
    - pass: real host config probe `E2E_KIMI=1 go test ./internal/agents/kimi -run TestKimiConfigOptionsE2EDoesNotCreateSession -count=1 -v -timeout 240s`
    - pass: real host smoke `E2E_KIMI=1 go test ./internal/agents/kimi -run TestKimiE2ESmoke -count=1 -v -timeout 180s`
    - observed failure: real host smoke `E2E_OPENCODE=1 go test ./internal/agents/opencode -run TestOpenCodeE2ESmoke -count=1 -v -timeout 180s` returned `opencode: session/new: context deadline exceeded`; tracked in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

- `Post-M8` Web UI/session reset regression fixed:
  - completed the `New session` fix after switching to a historical ACP session: clearing `thread.agentOptions.sessionId` still evicts stale empty-scope providers, and now also marks the next turn as an explicit fresh-session request so prompt building skips `[Conversation Summary]` / `[Recent Turns]` injection for that first turn.
  - kept the fresh-session marker server-internal: it is persisted in `thread.agent_options_json` only until the next `session_bound`, but stripped from public thread responses so the API contract stays stable.
  - added a backend regression test that reproduces the real `A -> historical B -> New session -> send` path and verifies the new session transcript contains only the new user/assistant exchange instead of wrapped prior thread history.
  - disabled composer send/input while the Web UI is switching thread sessions, preventing users from submitting a turn against a session selection that is still in flight.
  - validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/httpapi -run 'Test(NewSessionResetSkipsContextInjection|TurnSessionBoundPersistsSessionIDAndSkipsContextInjection|UpdateThreadClearingSessionDropsStaleUnboundProvider)' -count=1`
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- `Post-M8` session-history sqlite cache completed:
  - added SQLite table `session_transcript_cache` keyed by `(agent_id, cwd, session_id)` to persist provider-owned session replay snapshots separately from hub `turns/events`.
  - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/session-history` now reads sqlite first; on cache miss it still calls provider `LoadSessionTranscript`, then persists the normalized replay snapshot for later reuse.
  - cached session-history snapshots survive server restart, so revisiting the same historical session no longer requires a fresh provider `session/load` every time.
  - known tradeoff: cache freshness is not yet invalidated by provider `updatedAt` metadata; stale replay risk is tracked in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
  - validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/storage ./internal/httpapi -run 'Test(SessionTranscriptCacheCRUD|ThreadSessionHistoryEndpoint|ThreadSessionHistoryEndpointUsesSQLiteCacheAcrossRestart)$' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- `Post-M8` ACP `session/load` transcript replay standardization completed:
  - removed provider-specific transcript reconstruction for `kimi`, `opencode`, `codex`, and `qwen`; `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/session-history` now uses the same ACP path for all four providers:
    - resolve the selected session from ACP `session/list`
    - call ACP `session/load`
    - collect replayed `session/update` notifications into `user` / `assistant` messages
  - extended shared ACP update parsing to support standard `user_message_chunk` and `agent_message_chunk` replay events, and added a shared transcript collector for `session/load` history replay.
  - fixed Codex session replay to list and load within the same embedded runtime because Codex raw ACP `sessionId` values are runtime-scoped; cross-runtime reuse of `session-1`-style ids returns `unknown session`.
  - real regression on rebuilt ngent:
    - `kimi`: ACP `session/load` succeeds for historical sessions but Kimi CLI 1.20.0 emits no replay `session/update` notifications, so `/session-history` currently returns `supported=true` with an empty message list under the standard ACP-only implementation.
    - `qwen`: a real locally-created Qwen session now replays transcript messages through the same ACP `session/list` + `session/load` path; env-gated provider E2E confirms the replay contains the unique prompt marker from the created session.
  - validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/qwen -count=1`
    - pass: `E2E_QWEN=1 go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run 'TestQwenE2E(Smoke|SessionTranscriptReplay)$' -count=1 -v -timeout 180s`
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: real `opencode` `/session-history` regression on rebuilt ngent
    - pass: real `codex` `/session-history` regression on rebuilt ngent
    - observed: real `kimi` `session/load` returns no replay updates on Kimi CLI 1.20.0
- `Post-M8` Qwen session-history replay fix completed:
    - direct ACP `session/load` for that session replayed `user_message_chunk` and `agent_message_chunk`, proving Qwen itself was returning transcript content.
    - ngent `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/session-history?sessionId=...` initially failed with `503 UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` and `qwen: session/load: qwen: connection closed`.
  - root cause:
    - ngent transcript replay parsing treated Qwen `tool_call_update` notifications as fatal because their `content` payload is an array/object, not the `{type,text}` shape used by text chunks.
    - the ACP stdio transport closes the whole connection when a notification handler returns an error, so one unexpected Qwen update aborted the replay before the RPC response arrived.
  - fix:
    - relaxed shared ACP update parsing so only text-bearing `user_message_chunk` / `agent_message_chunk` notifications are decoded strictly; non-text update payloads are ignored instead of aborting replay.
    - extended Qwen transcript fake-process coverage to include a `tool_call_update` regression payload.
  - validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents -run 'TestParseACPUpdate' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run 'SessionTranscript' -count=1`
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

## Previous Update (2026-03-11)

- `Post-M8` codex session identity and replay normalization completed:
  - fixed fresh Codex `New session` persistence so ngent no longer stores provisional runtime ids like `session-1` as the thread session binding when a durable `_meta.threadId` is not yet available.
  - deferred initial `session_bound` persistence/emission for fresh Codex sessions until a stable session id can be resolved after the first prompt, then updated in-memory and persisted thread `agentOptions.sessionId` with the durable id.
  - validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/codex -run 'Test(CodexShouldDeferInitialSessionBinding|NormalizeCodexSessionListResultUsesStableThreadID|CodexSessionMatchesIDAcceptsStableAndRawIDs|CodexStableSessionIDFallsBackToRawSessionID)$' -count=1`

## Previous Update (2026-03-09)

- Kimi CLI ACP integration completed:
  - implemented `internal/agents/kimi` with one-turn ACP stdio lifecycle and fail-closed permission handling.
  - wired `kimi` into startup preflight, `/v1/agents`, thread allowlist, turn factory, model discovery, and startup config-catalog refresh.
  - added dual startup syntax fallback for current upstream docs drift: try `kimi acp`, then `kimi --acp` if ACP initialize closes immediately.
  - added fake-process provider tests, fallback coverage, and server/httpapi allowlist coverage.
  - fixed Kimi thread model switching: `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` with `configId=model` now selects the target model via Kimi process startup `--model`, instead of assuming ACP `session/set_config_option(model)` is implemented.
  - Kimi stream/config discovery paths now also pass the selected model through both process startup args and `session/new` hints for compatibility.
- Shared agent config/state refactor completed:
  - extracted common built-in agent fields `Dir`, `ModelID`, and `ConfigOverrides` into shared `internal/agents/agentutil.Config`.
  - extracted shared thread-safe mutable agent state into `internal/agents/agentutil.State`.
  - migrated `gemini`, `opencode`, `qwen`, `kimi`, `codex`, and `claude` to reuse the shared state helper instead of keeping duplicated per-provider copies of model/config override logic.
  - kept protocol/runtime behavior provider-specific; only constructor validation and common mutable state handling were unified.
- Web UI Kimi icon completed:
  - wired `kimi` avatar rendering in the Web UI to use the new asset with the existing `--contain` image treatment.
  - fixed the remaining New Thread modal agent-card icon map so Kimi now renders consistently there as well.
  - removed the forced white background from all `--contain` agent icons in message/thread views and from the modal's Kimi/OpenCode icon markup.
- validation:
  - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
  - pass: `go test ./...`

  - updated `/v1/agents` codex status: `unconfigured` when bin is absent, `available` when configured.
  - switched turn execution to per-thread lazy provider resolution (`TurnAgentFactory`), enabling codex ACP startup only when turn begins.
  - wired codex turns to `internal/agents/acp` with process working dir set to `thread.cwd`.
  - kept default test suite codex-independent and added optional env-gated codex smoke test (`E2E_CODEX=1`, `CODEX_ACP_GO_BIN`).

  - updated acceptance checklist with executable `go test` and `curl` verification commands.
- `Post-M8` maintenance completed:
  - finalized canonical Go module path as `github.com/beyond5959/ngent`.
  - replaced placeholder import path references across in-repo Go sources/tests.
- `Post-M8` embedded codex migration completed:
  - switched codex provider from external `codex-acp-go` path-based process spawning to embedded `github.com/beyond5959/acp-adapter/pkg/codexacp`.
  - removed user-facing codex binary path flags; codex runtime is now linked into server and lazily created per thread on first turn.
  - kept HTTP API semantics unchanged (`threads/turns/sse/permissions/history`) and preserved permission fail-closed round-trip.
  - updated `/v1/agents` codex status contract to runtime preflight-based `available|unavailable`.
  - updated codex smoke test gate to `E2E_CODEX=1` without `CODEX_ACP_GO_BIN` path dependency.
- `Post-M8` real local codex regression completed:
  - fixed embedded runtime lifecycle bug in `internal/agents/codex/embedded.go` (`runtime.Start(context.Background())` instead of timeout-bound context) and kept retry-on-turn-start-failure guard.
  - updated context composer so first turn with empty summary/history passes raw input, preserving slash-command semantics for embedded acp-adapter flows.
  - executed real HTTP/SSE regression with required prompts plus same-thread conflict (`409`), cancel convergence, and permission round-trip (`approved` + `declined`) using `/mcp call` on fresh threads.
- `Post-M8` docs refresh completed:
  - added root `README.md` in English with project goal, `go install` instructions, and startup examples (local/public/auth) using default DB home `$HOME/.ngent`.
  - removed manual `mkdir` steps from README startup examples and documented that server auto-creates `$HOME/.ngent` for default db path.
- `Post-M8` db-path default improvement completed:
  - changed default `--db-path` from relative `./ngent.db` to `$HOME/.ngent/ngent.db`.
  - added startup auto-create for db parent directory so users can run without explicitly passing `--db-path`.
  - added unit tests for default path resolution and db parent directory creation.
- `Post-M8` cwd policy simplification completed:
  - removed runtime CLI parameter `--allowed-root`.
  - server now allows user-specified absolute `cwd` paths by default.
  - updated docs and tests to reflect absolute-cwd policy.
- `Post-M8` docs framing update completed:
  - adjusted README/SPEC/API/ARCHITECTURE wording to emphasize ACP-compatible multi-agent goal.
  - kept current-state note explicit: built-in providers are `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, `gemini`, `kimi`, and `qwen`.
  - simplified README startup path to `ngent` with explicit `ngent --help` guidance.
- `Post-M8` startup log UX simplification completed:
  - replaced startup JSON line with multi-line human-readable stderr summary (QR code + port and URL hint).
  - added per-request completion logs containing `req_time`, `method`, `path`, `ip`, `status`, `duration_ms`, and `resp_bytes`.
  - normalized structured log `time` and request log `req_time` to UTC `time.DateTime` at second precision.
  - added unit test coverage for startup summary rendering and request completion log fields.
- `Post-M8` LAN-friendly default bind completed:
  - changed default bind to `0.0.0.0:8686` and `--allow-public` default to `true` so other devices can connect via the startup QR code.
- `Post-M8` qwen ACP integration completed:
  - implemented `internal/agents/qwen` with one-turn process lifecycle (`qwen --acp`) and ACP flow `initialize -> session/new -> session/prompt`.
  - implemented `session/update` delta extraction (`agent_message_chunk` + `content.text`) and `session/request_permission` fail-closed mapping (`approved/declined/cancelled`).
  - wired qwen into main server startup preflight, `/v1/agents` supported list, thread agent allowlist, and turn agent factory.
  - added/updated tests for qwen provider and server wiring (`main` + `httpapi` qwen allowlist coverage).
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `qwen --version` (`0.11.0`)
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/qwen -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./cmd/ngent ./internal/httpapi -count=1`
    - pass: `E2E_QWEN=1 go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run TestQwenE2ESmoke -v -timeout 120s`
- `Post-M8` ACP stdio transport refactor completed:
  - extracted shared transport package `internal/agents/acpstdio` (JSON-RPC stdio call/notify, inbound request handling, parse helpers, process termination helper).
  - refactored `internal/agents/opencode` and `internal/agents/qwen` to reuse `acpstdio` while preserving provider-specific behavior.
  - executed regression:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/opencode ./internal/agents/qwen -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./...`
    - pass: `E2E_OPENCODE=1 go test ./internal/agents/opencode -run TestOpenCodeE2ESmoke -v -timeout 90s`
    - pass: `E2E_QWEN=1 go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run TestQwenE2ESmoke -v -timeout 120s`
- `F2` completed:
  - created `src/types.ts`: full TypeScript interface set (Thread, Turn, Message, PermissionRequest, StreamState, AppState, etc.).
  - created `src/utils.ts`: generateUUID (crypto.randomUUID + fallback), formatTimestamp, formatRelativeTime, isAbsolutePath, escHtml, debounce.
  - created `src/store.ts`: singleton AppStore with pub/sub (subscribe → unsubscribe fn) and localStorage persistence for browser settings.
  - created `src/components/settings-panel.ts`: slide-in drawer for browser-local connection/auth/theme controls; settings persist immediately.
  - updated `src/main.ts`: imports store for theme init, wires settings button → settingsPanel.open(), system-theme change listener.
  - added settings drawer CSS to style.css (overlay, slide-in animation, theme button group).
  - implemented complete CSS design system with CSS custom properties for light/dark themes (`[data-theme]`).
  - built two-column IM layout: 260px sidebar (brand, search, thread list, settings footer) + flex main chat area.
  - thread list items with avatar, title, preview, agent badge, relative time, and unread dot.
  - chat header with thread title, agent badge, cwd, compact/cancel action buttons.
  - scrollable message list with user bubbles (right, blue) and agent bubbles (left, neutral), typing indicator, permission card, day divider.
  - input area with auto-resize textarea, send button, and keyboard hint.
  - empty state for no-thread-selected view.
  - basic responsive: ≤768px sidebar hides, mobile menu toggle shows.
  - system-theme detection on boot + `prefers-color-scheme` listener for live updates.
  - initialized Vite + TypeScript frontend under `internal/webui/web/`.
  - created `internal/webui/webui.go` with `//go:embed web/dist` and SPA fallback handler.
  - registered `FrontendHandler` in `httpapi.Config`; non-API paths served by frontend, API routes unaffected.
  - updated `cmd/ngent/main.go` to pass `webui.Handler()` and print a startup QR code for opening the UI.
  - updated `Makefile` with `build-web`, `build` targets; updated `.gitignore` for `node_modules`.
  - `go test ./...` all green; end-to-end: `GET /` → 200 HTML, `/threads` SPA fallback → 200, `/v1/agents` → JSON, `/healthz` → JSON.
  - standardized `/v1/agents` display names to `Codex` and `Claude Code`.
  - synchronized test fixtures and API documentation examples with the same canonical names.
  - `/v1/agents` output uses display names (not lowercase ids): `Codex`, `Claude Code`.
- `F3` completed:
  - created `src/api.ts`: ApiClient with ApiError class; getAgents(), getThreads(), createThread(); reads serverUrl/authToken from store on every request and sends the compatibility client header internally.
  - created `src/components/new-thread-modal.ts`: centered modal with agent card grid (radio, disabled for unavailable), CWD absolute-path validation, optional title, collapsible JSON agent-options textarea, submit with spinner, error banner; targeted DOM updates avoid full re-render during typing.
  - appended modal/form/agent-grid/skeleton/spinner CSS to style.css.
  - rewrote `src/main.ts`: init() loads agents+threads in parallel, store.subscribe drives updateThreadList()+updateChatArea(); skeleton loading state; search filter; thread click sets activeThreadId; new-thread button opens modal; error banner on API failure.
  - `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go test ./...` all green.
- `F4` completed:
  - created `src/sse.ts`: `TurnStream` class using `fetch` + `ReadableStream` (not `EventSource`, which lacks POST/header support); parses `event:/data:` SSE lines delimited by `\n\n`; dispatches `onTurnStarted`, `onDelta`, `onCompleted`, `onError`, `onPermissionRequired`, `onDisconnect` callbacks; supports `abort()` for clean cancellation.
  - added `startTurn(threadId, input, callbacks)` and `cancelTurn(turnId)` to `ApiClient` in `src/api.ts`.
  - rewrote `src/main.ts` with full message rendering and smart subscribe handler:
    - `handleSend()`: adds user message → sets `activeStreamMsgId` sentinel → sets store streamState → appends streaming bubble to DOM → starts SSE stream.
    - `onDelta`: targeted DOM update on `#bubble-<id>` (no re-render, no flicker); removes typing indicator on first delta.
    - `onCompleted`/`onError`/`onDisconnect`: clears stream tracking → adds finalized message to store → clears streamState; subscribe re-renders list with final message.
    - subscribe handler: full `updateChatArea()` only on thread switch; skips `updateMessageList()` while `activeStreamMsgId` is set (streaming bubble live in DOM); `updateInputState()` always.
    - `handleCancel()`: sets store streamState to `cancelling`, calls `api.cancelTurn()`.
    - Cancel button in chat header: hidden by default, shown during streaming via `updateInputState()`.
  - added `.chat-header-meta` style to `style.css`.
  - `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go test ./...` all green.

- `F5` completed:
  - added `api.getHistory(threadId)` calling `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/history`, returns `Turn[]`.
  - added `turnsToMessages(turns)`: converts server `Turn[]` to client `Message[]`; skips `isInternal` turns; uses stable IDs `${turnId}-u` / `${turnId}-a`; maps `cancelled`/`error`/`completed` turn statuses to `MessageStatus`; falls back `completedAt → createdAt` for timestamp.
  - added `loadHistory(threadId)`: async, loads history on thread switch; guards against stale response (navigated away / streaming in progress); updates `store.messages[threadId]`.
  - updated `updateChatArea()`: shows cached messages immediately on revisit (no spinner flash); shows centered loading spinner for first visit; always fires `loadHistory()` in background to keep view fresh.
  - added `.message-list-loading` + `.loading-spinner` CSS (centered spinner, reuses `@keyframes spin`).
  - `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go test ./...` all green.

- `F6` completed:
  - created `src/components/permission-card.ts`: `mountPermissionCard(listEl, event)` appends an inline permission card to the message list; 15s countdown timer with `setInterval` at 100ms ticks; Allow/Deny buttons call `api.resolvePermission()`; 409 (already resolved) treated as silent success; `showResolved()` snaps progress bar width, recolors card header/border, replaces buttons with resolved label; timeout auto-transitions to `permission-card--timeout` state.
  - added `api.resolvePermission(permissionId, outcome)` — `POST /v1/permissions/{permissionId}`.
  - wired `onPermissionRequired` callback in `handleSend()`: calls `mountPermissionCard(listEl, event)`.
  - added CSS: `.permission-progress` + `.permission-progress-bar` (width-animated, `transition: width .1s linear`); `.permission-card--approved|declined|timeout` outcome states (border + header recolor); `.permission-resolved--approved|declined|timeout` label colors; `.perm-avatar` warning-color avatar.
  - `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go test ./...` all green.

- `F7` completed:
  - created `src/markdown.ts`: configured `marked@^9` with custom renderer; `html()` override returns `escHtml(text)` (XSS protection); `code()` renderer emits `.code-block` HTML with hljs syntax highlighting, header (lang label + Copy button), `<pre>` with `<code class="hljs">`, and optional "Show all N lines" expand button for blocks >20 lines; registered go/typescript/javascript/python/bash/json/yaml language subset.
  - exported `renderMarkdown(text)` — calls `marked.parse` synchronously.
  - exported `bindMarkdownControls(container)` — binds `.code-copy-btn` (clipboard + 2s "Copied ✓" feedback), `.code-expand-btn` (toggle `code-pre--collapsed`), `.msg-copy-btn` (full bubble text copy); idempotent via `data-bound` guard.
  - updated `src/main.ts`: imported `renderMarkdown` + `bindMarkdownControls`; `renderMessage()` uses `renderMarkdown(bodyText)` + `message-bubble--md` class for agent `done` messages; adds `<button class="msg-copy-btn">⎘</button>` in message-meta for done messages; `updateMessageList()` calls `bindMarkdownControls(listEl)` after HTML injection.
  - added CSS to `style.css`: `.message-bubble--md` (white-space: normal; nested p/h1-h3/ul/ol/blockquote/inline-code/a styles); `.message--agent .message-group { max-width: min(660px, 90%) }` for code block width; `.code-block`, `.code-block-header`, `.code-lang`, `.code-copy-btn` (hover-visible, 2s "Copied ✓" variant); `.code-pre`, `.code-pre--collapsed` (340px max-height + gradient fade `::after`); `.code-expand-btn` (full-width, text-secondary); `.msg-copy-btn` (hover-visible on agent message hover); hljs CSS-variable token colour system with light/dark variants.
  - `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go test ./...` all green.

- `F8` completed:
  - added `isNearBottom(el)` helper (100px threshold).
  - smart auto-scroll in `onDelta`: only scrolls when user is already at/near bottom; lets user read history uninterrupted during streaming.
  - added scroll-to-bottom button (`.scroll-bottom-btn`) positioned absolute in new `.message-list-wrap` container: shown when user scrolls away from bottom, hidden on `updateMessageList` and smooth-scroll on click.
  - added `bindScrollBottom()`: scroll-event listener syncs button visibility; button `click` calls `listEl.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' })`.
  - added `bindGlobalShortcuts()` (called once from `init()`):
    - `/` key: focuses `#search-input` when not already in an input (preventDefault).
    - `Cmd+N` / `Ctrl+N`: opens new thread modal.
    - `Escape` (contextual, most-specific first): (1) closes mobile sidebar if open, (2) clears + blurs search if search is focused, (3) cancels active stream via `handleCancel()`.
  - mobile UX: thread click in `updateThreadList()` now removes `sidebar--open` class so sidebar closes automatically on thread select.
  - input hint updated to reflect shortcuts: `⌘ Enter to send · Esc to cancel · / to search`.
  - CSS: `.message-list` wrapped in `.message-list-wrap` (`flex:1; position:relative; min-height:0; overflow:hidden`); `.message-list` changed from `flex:1` to `height:100%`; `.scroll-bottom-btn` circular, shadow, hover translate.
  - `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go test ./...` all green.

- `F9` completed:
  - updated startup output to include a QR code with port hint (for LAN access) and updated `TestPrintStartupSummary`.
  - updated `docs/API.md`: added Frontend Web UI endpoint section (`GET /` returns `text/html`, `GET /assets/*` serves static assets, SPA fallback for non-API paths).
  - updated `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`: added Requirement 13 (Embedded Web UI) with `go test ./internal/webui` verification command.
  - updated `README.md`: added "Web UI" section with startup summary example, feature list (threads/streaming/permissions/history/themes), no-Node-at-runtime note, and `make build-web && go build ./...` rebuild instructions.
  - verified ADR-018 (Embedded Web UI via Go embed) already present in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
  - final verification: `go test ./...` all green; `tsc -b && vite build` passes; `go build ./...` succeeds.

### Done (all frontend milestones)
- Optional enhancement 1: add embedded-runtime preflight diagnostics endpoint (auth, app-server reachability, version compatibility).
- Optional enhancement 2: WebSocket streaming transport in addition to SSE.
- Optional enhancement 3: History/event pagination and cursor-based replay.
- Optional enhancement 4: RBAC and finer-grained authorization policies.
- Optional enhancement 5: Expanded audit logs and retention tooling.
- Optional enhancement 6: expose environment diagnostics for codex local state DB/schema mismatches (for example `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite` migration drift) and app-server method compatibility.

- `Post-M8` Claude Code embedded provider completed:
  - implemented `internal/agents/claude/embedded.go` backed by `github.com/beyond5959/acp-adapter/pkg/claudeacp.EmbeddedRuntime`.
  - preflight checks `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable; status reports `available` when set, `unavailable` otherwise.
  - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` are read from environment via `claudeacp.DefaultRuntimeConfig()` at startup.
- `Post-M8` thread delete lifecycle completed:
  - added `DELETE /v1/threads/{threadId}` with same-client ownership check and `409 CONFLICT` when a thread has an active turn.
  - guarded deletion with a temporary turn-controller lock to prevent new turns from starting during delete.
  - implemented transactional storage deletion in `internal/storage` with dependent cleanup (`events` -> `turns` -> `threads`).
  - wired Web UI thread-list delete action with confirmation and local state cleanup (threads/messages/active selection/stream state).
  - executed validation:
  - added unit tests (`TestPreflight_*`, `TestNew_*`, `TestClose_*`, `TestDefaultRuntimeConfig_ReadsEnv`) covering token presence/absence, default/custom timeouts, and idempotent close.
  - added optional real smoke test (`E2E_CLAUDE=1 go test ./internal/agents/claude/ -run TestClaudeE2ESmoke -v -timeout 120s`); confirmed `PONG` response and `stopReason=end_turn` (16.68s).
  - wired claude into `cmd/ngent/main.go`: preflight call, `"claude"` in `AllowedAgentIDs`, `case "claude"` in `TurnAgentFactory`, real status in `supportedAgents`.
  - updated `main_test.go`: `supportedAgents` signature extended with `claudeAvailable bool`; added claude id/status assertions.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go build ./...`
    - pass: `go test ./...` (all packages green)
    - pass: `E2E_CLAUDE=1 go test ./internal/agents/claude -run TestClaudeE2ESmoke -v -timeout 120s` (response: `PONG`, stopReason: `end_turn`)

- `Post-F9` CI and release pipeline completed:
  - removed `internal/webui/web/dist/` and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` from git tracking (`git rm --cached`); added both to `.gitignore`.
  - created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: triggers on every push/PR (non-tag); steps: Go + Node.js 20 setup, `make build-web`, gofmt check, `go test ./...`.
  - created `.github/workflows/release.yml`: triggers on `v*.*.*` tags; runs `goreleaser release --clean` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
  - created `.goreleaser.yml` (version 2): `before.hooks: make build-web`; cross-compiles linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64 (windows arm64 excluded) with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; produces `ngent_VERSION_OS_ARCH.tar.gz` archives + `checksums.txt`.
  - updated `Makefile`: `make build` now outputs to `bin/ngent` (was `go build ./...`).
  - updated `README.md`: replaced `go install` with "Download pre-built binary" table + "Build from source" (`make build`) instructions.
  - updated `AGENTS.md`: replaced "MUST keep web/dist committed" rule with "MUST NOT commit web/dist"; added CI/Release pipeline section.

## Notes

- Canonical module path is now finalized as `github.com/beyond5959/ngent`.
- All in-repo Go import paths were updated from placeholder path to canonical path.

- `Post-F9` Web UI multi-thread streaming behavior fixed:
  - removed UI behavior that aborted an in-flight SSE stream when switching threads.
  - changed client stream tracking from single global `streamState` to per-thread `streamStates`.
  - maintained per-thread stream runtime maps (stream handle, delta buffer, start time), so background threads can keep streaming and finalize correctly.
  - wired send/cancel/input disable logic to current thread only, enabling concurrent in-flight turns across different threads.
  - executed validation:

- `Post-F9` permission countdown updated to 2 hours:
  - changed server default permission timeout to `2 * time.Hour`.
  - changed Web UI Permission Required countdown to 2 hours and display format to `H:MM:SS`.

- `Post-F9` permission card persistence across thread switch fixed:
  - stored pending permission requests per thread in Web UI runtime state.
  - when switching back to a thread, pending Permission Required cards are re-mounted with original deadline.
  - resolved/timeout outcomes remove pending records to avoid stale prompts.
  - executed validation:

- `Post-F9` thread model selection and switching completed:
  - added thread update API `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` (agentOptions-only payload) with ownership checks and active-turn conflict (`409`).
  - added model discovery API `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/models` (ACP handshake-backed).
  - storage layer now supports `UpdateThreadAgentOptions` and updates thread `updated_at`.
  - successful thread option update closes cached per-thread provider, so next turn re-initializes with new model config.
  - wired runtime model discovery into all providers:
    - `codex`/`claude`: ACP embedded `session/new.configOptions`.
    - `gemini`/`kimi`/`opencode`/`qwen`: ACP `session/new.models.availableModels`.
  - wired `agentOptions.modelId` forwarding into all providers:
    - embedded `codex`/`claude` now pass `model` in ACP `session/new`.
    - `gemini` now passes `model` in `session/new` and `session/prompt`.
    - `kimi` passes `model` in `session/prompt`, and uses `model` + `modelId` during config/model discovery handshakes.
    - `opencode` passes `modelId` in `session/prompt`; `qwen` passes `model` in `session/prompt`.
  - Web UI updates:
    - new-thread modal model selector removed (create flow keeps agent/cwd/title/advanced JSON only).
    - active thread header switched from free-text model input to ACP-backed model dropdown + Apply action.
    - model controls are disabled while model lists load and during streaming turns.
  - executed validation:

- `Post-F9` thread session model config switched to ACP `configOptions`:
  - added thread-scoped config options APIs:
    - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options`
    - `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options`
  - `POST` persists selected model/config state directly into sqlite thread metadata (no separate apply endpoint/action).
  - provider-side config option support added across all built-in agents so persisted thread selections can be synchronized at turn boundaries:
    - embedded: `codex`, `claude` (cached runtime session sync).
    - stdio: `opencode`, `qwen`, `gemini`, `kimi` (per-turn ACP handshake plus persisted selection forwarding).
  - Web UI changes:
    - removed thread header `Apply` button.
    - model dropdown persists immediately on selection.
    - model source switched from agent-level model catalog to thread-level `configOptions` (`category=model`).
    - model option descriptions are rendered under the selector in the chat header.
  - thread metadata sync:
    - successful model switch persists `agentOptions.modelId` for thread continuity and restart recovery.
  - executed validation:

- `Post-F9` thread reasoning selector and config override persistence completed:
  - backend now persists non-model session config selections under `agentOptions.configOverrides` when `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` succeeds.
  - provider factories now restore persisted config overrides on fresh embedded sessions and per-turn stdio handshakes, so reasoning-style settings survive across future turns and restarts.
  - Web UI composer footer now renders both `Model` and `Reasoning` controls; reasoning options refresh from the latest thread `configOptions` after model changes.
  - reasoning control remains model-specific and is disabled/updated in the same active-turn safety envelope as model switching.
  - added coverage for config override persistence and thread agent-option parsing.
  - executed validation:

- `Post-F9` shared agent config catalog caching completed:
  - Web UI no longer re-fetches thread config options when switching between threads that use the same agent and already have a cached agent config catalog.
  - frontend now keeps:
    - thread-scoped current config state cache.
    - agent-scoped shared config catalog cache for model/reasoning option lists.
  - same-agent threads reuse the same model/reasoning lists while keeping independent selected current values derived from each thread's persisted `agentOptions`.
  - composer footer pills now show only the selected model/reasoning names, without leading `MODEL` / `REASONING` labels.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

- `Post-F9` codex model-discovery stability improvement:
  - replaced per-request codex model discovery runtime startup/shutdown with a shared discovery client in `internal/agents/codex/models.go`.
  - behavior changes:
    - repeated `GET /v1/agents/codex/models` now reuses initialized embedded runtime instead of spawning and closing app-server each time.
    - one automatic retry with fresh discovery client when cached client becomes unhealthy.
    - explicit cleanup hook added in server shutdown (`codexagent.CloseDiscoveryClient()`).
  - local validation:
    - first call `GET /v1/agents/codex/models` took ~16s (initial discovery).
    - second call returned in ~0ms from shared client (no repeated startup/shutdown).

- `Post-F9` persisted agent config catalog completed:
  - added sqlite-backed `agent_config_catalogs` storage keyed by `agent_id + model_id`, with a reserved default snapshot row used when a thread has no explicit model selection yet.
  - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` and `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/models` now read persisted catalog data first, so service restart can keep serving model/reasoning metadata without blocking on live provider queries.
  - `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` now writes through both:
    - thread-local selected values into `threads.agent_options_json`
    - current model config catalog into sqlite for reuse across threads/restarts
  - service startup now launches a background catalog refresher that silently re-queries built-in agents and refreshes stored model/reasoning catalogs without delaying frontend availability.
  - Web UI config cache is now keyed by `agent + selected model`, so different threads on the same agent no longer accidentally reuse the wrong reasoning list for another model.

- `Post-F9` streaming bubble typing-indicator persistence completed:
  - Web UI streaming agent bubble now keeps the three animated dots rendered at the bottom of the bubble after the first delta arrives, until the turn finishes.
  - refactored transient streaming bubble DOM to use separate text and indicator regions so incremental `onDelta` updates no longer replace the indicator.

- `Post-F9` Web UI clipboard fallback and message-copy fix completed:
  - unified copy actions behind a best-effort clipboard helper that falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')` when `navigator.clipboard` is unavailable or blocked on LAN HTTP origins.
  - message copy buttons now copy the original message text payload instead of scraping rendered DOM text, so agent markdown replies no longer pull in code-block chrome such as `Copy` labels.
  - applied the same fallback path to code-block copy and settings-panel client-id copy to keep behavior consistent across the UI.

- `Post-F9` streaming bubble empty-line removal:
  - removed the blank spacer above the three animated dots before the first token arrives by hiding the empty text container in streaming bubbles.
  - typing indicator now sits directly under the top padding until real content starts streaming.

- `Post-F9` sidebar thread activity indicators completed:
  - thread list now shows a live spinner for any thread with an in-flight turn, so background work stays visible after switching to another thread.
  - when a background turn finishes, the spinner flips to a green check badge that stays on that thread until the user opens it again.
  - slowed the sidebar thread spinner slightly so the activity indicator reads as background work instead of a high-frequency busy loop.

- `Post-F9` sidebar thread drawer actions and rename completed:
  - replaced the direct delete icon in sidebar thread rows with a drawer trigger.
  - added drawer actions for inline rename and delete, with rename ordered before delete and delete styled as the only dangerous text action.
  - extended `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` so thread title updates reuse the existing ownership and active-turn conflict model.

- `Post-F9` sidebar thread action popover refinement completed:
  - replaced the expanding inline drawer with a floating popover anchored to the three-dot trigger, so opening thread actions no longer changes sidebar row height.
  - kept rename and delete in the same order, with rename editing rendered in a floating panel and delete remaining the red dangerous action.
  - executed validation:

- `Post-F9` ACP plan streaming in Web UI completed:
  - added shared ACP `session/update` parsing for both `agent_message_chunk` and `plan`, with plan routed through a new per-turn `PlanHandler` context callback.
  - introduced SSE/history event `plan_update` so ACP plans are persisted alongside other turn events instead of being dropped at provider boundaries.
  - updated the Web UI to render live plan cards during streaming and restore the latest plan from turn history on reload.

 
- 2026-03-06: Removed the thread action trigger's per-thread actionLabel/title tooltip in the Web UI popover menu; the three-dot button now uses a neutral `aria-label` only, without hover text tied to the thread title.
- 2026-03-06: Moved the sidebar thread action menu and rename form into a sidebar-level floating layer instead of rendering them inside each thread row, so the rename UI is no longer clipped by the thread list or sidebar overflow.
- 2026-03-06: fixed embedded codex permission bridge timeout mismatch by aligning adapter-side `session/request_permission` wait window to 2h (was 30s), matching hub default timeout and avoiding premature fail-closed during manual approval.
- 2026-03-06: fixed embedded codex server-request compatibility for tool interaction:
  - `item/tool/requestUserInput` now returns schema-compatible answers (auto-select first option label per question) instead of `-32000 not supported`.
  - `item/tool/call` now returns structured tool failure payload (`success=false`) instead of JSON-RPC method error, so app-server no longer aborts the whole flow on this request type.
- 2026-03-09: unified ACP message-chunk constant usage across stdio providers by removing per-provider `updateTypeMessageChunk` definitions and reusing `agents.ACPUpdateTypeMessageChunk`.
- 2026-03-09: hid the Web UI Reasoning switch when the active agent exposes fewer than two reasoning choices, so agents without switchable reasoning no longer show a dead control.
- 2026-03-11: added opt-in `--debug` startup flag; when enabled, stderr now emits sanitized `acp.message` traces for ACP stdio and embedded-runtime request/response traffic, including session prompts, updates, and permission flows.
- 2026-03-11: added ACP session browsing/resume support across built-in agents:
  - introduced shared agent session abstractions for `session/list`, bound-session reporting, and initialize capability parsing.
  - built-in providers now:
    - list sessions through ACP `session/list` when supported.
    - load persisted `agentOptions.sessionId` through ACP `session/load` before prompting.
    - report the effective session id back to HTTP turns so the server can persist it.
  - added `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/sessions` with cursor passthrough and graceful `supported=false` fallback for agents without ACP session-history support.
  - turn SSE now emits `session_bound`, and the server persists the thread session id without closing the active provider.
  - once a thread is bound to an ACP session, prompt building skips local recent-turn injection to avoid duplicating already-loaded ACP context.
  - Web UI now renders a right-side session sidebar with first-page load, `Show more`, active-session highlighting, and `New session` reset.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./internal/httpapi -run 'TestThreadSessionsListEndpoint|TestTurnSessionBoundPersistsSessionIDAndSkipsContextInjection' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-11: fixed Web UI session playback when selecting an existing ACP session from the right sidebar.
  - the active chat view now treats `(threadId, sessionId)` as its render scope instead of refreshing only on `threadId` changes.
  - `loadHistory()` now filters locally persisted turns by each turn's `session_bound` event so the center chat panel replays the selected session's ngent-recorded turns instead of leaving the previous session on screen.
  - session changes reported mid-stream by `session_bound` defer the full chat refresh until the active turn completes, so the live streaming bubble is not destroyed.

- 2026-03-11: fixed Web UI history replay for legacy session threads whose `/history` data lacks per-turn `session_bound` events.
  - session-scoped history filtering now falls back to showing all turns when a thread has no annotated session markers at all, instead of rendering an empty chat pane despite non-empty `/history`.
  - when a thread has exactly one annotated session, the selected session view also keeps older unannotated turns so pre-annotation history is still visible for that same session.

- 2026-03-13: allowed concurrent turns across different sessions on the same thread.
  - changed the runtime turn controller from thread-wide locking to `(threadId, sessionId)` scoping, while keeping delete/compact/shared thread mutations guarded at whole-thread scope.
  - changed cached provider reuse from thread scope to session/config scope so switching sessions mid-stream no longer reuses the wrong provider instance.
  - updated the Web UI to key cached messages, live stream state, and permission cards by `(threadId, sessionId)`, which keeps background session output from overwriting the currently visible session.
  - session-only `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` updates now succeed while another session on the same thread is active, so the right-side session switcher can move to a new session before starting the next turn.

- 2026-03-13: fixed Web UI session switching while another session on the same thread is still streaming.
  - the chat subscribe loop now forces a full chat-area rebuild when the selected `(threadId, sessionId)` changes to a scope with an active stream whose bubble is not mounted in the current DOM.
  - returning to a background-streaming session now restores the loading/typing bubble, live partial text, and pending permission UI instead of rendering only the persisted message list.

- 2026-03-13: moved working-directory details into a chat-header Session Info popover in the Web UI.
  - removed the visible working-directory line from the chat header and added an info icon that appears only when the selected session already has a persisted `sessionId`.
  - clicking the icon now opens a `Session Info` popover showing `Session ID` and `Working Directory`, each with a dedicated copy action; clicking outside or pressing `Esc` closes it.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-13: added per-session loading indicators to the Web UI session sidebar.
  - the right-side `Sessions` list now shows the same spinner used by the left agent list when a specific `sessionId` on the active thread is still streaming.
  - session items derive their loading state from scope-local `streamStates`, so background activity is shown only on the matching session row.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-13: added persisted ACP slash-command support across built-in agents and the Web UI composer.
  - extended shared ACP `session/update` parsing with `available_commands_update`, and wired all built-in ACP providers to forward the latest slash-command snapshot through a shared per-turn callback.
  - added SQLite-backed `agent_slash_commands` caching plus `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands`, so every observed slash-command update is persisted and survives server restart.
  - updated the Web UI composer so typing `/` into an otherwise empty chat input opens a codex-style slash-command picker with keyboard navigation and command insertion for the active agent.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-13: fixed Web UI freezes when an agent has no cached slash commands.
  - changed the composer to fetch `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` lazily when the user types `/`, instead of preloading on thread selection.
  - empty slash-command snapshots now close the picker immediately and leave `/` as ordinary message text, which avoids the previous empty-result refresh loop.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-13: fixed Kimi slash-command loss in the ACP turn pipeline.
  - root cause: real Kimi `kimi acp` emits `available_commands_update` immediately after `session/new` and before `session/prompt`, while the ngent Kimi provider had been installing its `session/update` handler too late and silently dropped that notification.
  - fixed the Kimi provider to start observing `session/update` before `session/new/session/load`, while still suppressing pre-prompt message chunks so transcript replay cannot leak into the live response stream.
  - added a regression test that forces `available_commands_update` to arrive during `session/new`.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/kimi -run 'TestStream(CapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|WithFakeProcess|WithFakeProcessModelID)$' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./...`
    - pass: real local ngent + Kimi test on `http://127.0.0.1:8788` confirmed `session/update.available_commands_update` was logged between `session/new` and `session/prompt`
    - pass: `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` returned 8 persisted Kimi commands after the first turn

- 2026-03-13: forced a backend slash-command refresh on each new `/` interaction in the Web UI.
  - root cause: once a thread had already populated the client-side slash-command cache, typing `/` reused that cache and did not issue another `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands`, which made the real network behavior diverge from the expected "query sqlite on slash entry" flow.
  - changed the composer so the first bare `/` in each slash interaction triggers a forced refresh for the active thread, while subsequent filtering inside the same interaction still reuses the in-memory snapshot.
  - the refresh guard resets when the user leaves slash mode, selects a command, sends the message, presses `Esc`, or clicks outside the composer.

    - pass: real local ngent + Kimi test on `http://127.0.0.1:8789`
    
- 2026-03-13: fixed codex embedded slash-command loss when `session/new` / `session/load` emitted updates before the first prompt.
  - root cause: the codex embedded provider subscribed to runtime updates only inside `streamOnce()`, but `acp-adapter` emits `available_commands_update` immediately after `session/new` / `session/load`, so the initial slash-command snapshot was dropped before ngent had any subscriber.
  - installed a runtime-level update monitor before `session/new` / `session/load`, cached the latest slash-command snapshot on the provider, and replayed that cached snapshot into each turn context before `session/prompt` starts.
  - kept prompt-time `available_commands_update` handling in the live stream path so later slash-command changes still propagate with the existing cancellation/error behavior.
  - added codex regression coverage for both the direct first-turn path and the "config options initialized the runtime before the first turn" path.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/codex -run 'TestStream(CapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|ReplaysCachedSlashCommandsAfterConfigOptionsInit)$' -count=1`
    - pass: real local ngent + codex test on `http://127.0.0.1:8793`
    - pass: `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` returned the persisted 7-command codex snapshot after the first turn
    - pass: sqlite `/tmp/ngent-codex-fix.db` stored `agent_id=codex` with 7 slash commands

- 2026-03-13: fixed the same pre-prompt slash-command timing bug in Qwen and OpenCode stdio providers.
  - root cause: both stdio providers called `session/new` / `session/load` before registering a `session/update` notification handler, and `acpstdio.Conn` drops notifications when no handler is installed.
  - moved notification handler registration to immediately after `initialize`, allowed `available_commands_update` through before prompt start, and continued suppressing pre-prompt transcript chunks/plan updates so session replay cannot leak into live output.
  - added one fake-process regression test per provider to verify `available_commands_update` emitted during `session/new` is captured.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/qwen ./internal/agents/opencode -run 'TestStream(CapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|WithFakeProcess|WithFakeProcessModelID)?$' -count=1`
    - pass: real local ngent + qwen/opencode test on `http://127.0.0.1:8794`

- 2026-03-13: deduplicated ACP stdio stream notification handling across Kimi, Qwen, and OpenCode.
  - extracted one shared `agents.InstallACPStdioNotificationHandler(...)` helper that owns the common `session/update` parsing path for pre-prompt slash-command snapshots plus post-prompt message/plan streaming.
  - removed the previous copy-pasted handler bodies from the three providers so future slash-command or plan-stream changes only need one stdio implementation update.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/kimi ./internal/agents/qwen ./internal/agents/opencode -run 'TestStream(CapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|WithFakeProcess|WithFakeProcessModelID)?$' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-13: applied the same pre-prompt slash-command handling and shared notification helper to Gemini.
  - Gemini had the same timing bug as the other stdio-backed providers: it registered `session/update` handling only after `session/new` / `session/load`, so any early `available_commands_update` would have been dropped by its custom `rpcConn`.
  - generalized the shared stdio logic into `agents.NewACPNotificationHandler(...)`, reused it from the existing stdio helper, and wired Gemini's custom `rpcConn` through the same handler builder.
  - added Gemini fake-process regression coverage for `available_commands_update` emitted during `session/new`.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/gemini -run 'TestStream(CapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|WithFakeProcess|WithFakeProcessModelID)$' -count=1`
    - pass: real local ngent + Gemini test on `http://127.0.0.1:8795`
    - note: `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` still returned `[]` in that real run, which indicates Gemini CLI did not emit `available_commands_update` on that session despite the handler now being installed early enough

- 2026-03-13: backfilled Codex slash commands during thread config initialization so `/` works before the first turn.
  - root cause: the Web UI opens Codex threads by loading `config-options`, which initializes the embedded runtime and caches `available_commands_update` in provider memory, but sqlite remained empty until a later turn replayed the snapshot through the normal turn-scoped slash-command handler.
  - added a shared `agents.SlashCommandsProvider` interface, implemented it in the embedded Codex provider, and taught the HTTP `config-options` path to persist a missing slash-command snapshot from the live provider as a best-effort backfill.
  - added regression coverage for both the provider method and the HTTP old-thread case where config options are already stored but slash commands are still missing from sqlite.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/codex -run 'Test(StreamCapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|StreamReplaysCachedSlashCommandsAfterConfigOptionsInit|SlashCommandsAfterConfigOptionsInit)$' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./internal/httpapi -run 'Test(ThreadSlashCommandsPersistAndLoad|ThreadSlashCommandsPersistAcrossRestart|ThreadConfigOptionsBackfillsSlashCommandsWhenCatalogAlreadyStored)$' -count=1`
    - pass: real local ngent + codex test on `http://127.0.0.1:8796`
    - pass: fresh Codex thread returned the 7-command slash snapshot from `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` immediately after `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options`, before any turn was sent

- 2026-03-13: fixed fresh-thread Qwen slash commands by probing providers on `/slash-commands` cache miss.
  - root cause: a user could type `/` before the thread-opening `config-options` request finished; for Qwen that meant `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` read sqlite too early and returned `[]` even though the provider emitted `available_commands_update` a moment later.
  - implemented `SlashCommandsProvider` on the Qwen stdio provider, cached slash-command snapshots inside the provider from both turn and config-session ACP notifications, and taught `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` to best-effort backfill sqlite directly from the live provider when the row is missing.
  - added regression coverage for Qwen `ConfigOptions()` followed by `SlashCommands()`, plus one HTTP test that verifies the slash-commands endpoint itself backfills a missing snapshot.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/qwen ./internal/httpapi -run 'Test(StreamCapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|SlashCommandsAfterConfigOptionsInit|ThreadConfigOptionsBackfillsSlashCommandsWhenCatalogAlreadyStored|ThreadSlashCommandsEndpointBackfillsMissingSnapshot)$' -count=1`
    - pass: real local ngent + qwen test on `http://127.0.0.1:8798`
    - pass: fresh Qwen thread returned `/bug`, `/compress`, `/init`, and `/summary` from the very first `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` before any turn was sent

- 2026-03-13: unified provider-local ACP slash-command caching across the direct stdio agents.
  - Kimi, Qwen, OpenCode, and Gemini all share the same underlying ACP behavior: `available_commands_update` can arrive during `session/new` in both turn streaming and config-session probes, so probing slash commands only from sqlite is not enough for fresh threads.
  - introduced `agents.SlashCommandsCache` and wired all four direct ACP providers to feed it from both `Stream()` and `runConfigSession()` by wrapping the request context's slash-command handler instead of duplicating provider-local cache plumbing.
  - each provider now implements `SlashCommandsProvider`, so thread initialization and `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/slash-commands` can backfill sqlite from the live provider snapshot even before the first turn persists anything.
  - added config-session regression coverage for Kimi, OpenCode, and Gemini to lock in the `ConfigOptions() -> SlashCommands()` path alongside the earlier Qwen test.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/agents/kimi ./internal/agents/opencode ./internal/agents/gemini ./internal/agents/qwen -run 'Test(StreamCapturesSlashCommandsEmittedBeforePrompt|SlashCommandsAfterConfigOptionsInit|WithFakeProcess|WithFakeProcessModelID)$' -count=1`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-14: fixed real Kimi/Qwen ACP permission requests that carried structured `toolCall` previews instead of flat strings.
  - root cause: the direct ACP provider adapters decoded `session/request_permission.toolCall` as `map[string]string`, but real Kimi 1.22.0 sends rich payloads with `content` arrays and diff metadata, so JSON decode failed and ngent immediately returned a fail-closed reject without emitting `permission_required`.
  - updated Kimi and Qwen to use the shared parser, added regression coverage for real-style rich payloads, and normalized `agent_thought_chunk` as the same hidden-thought update family used by the rest of ngent's ACP parser.
  - updated the Web UI streaming bubble to show `Thinking...` immediately before the first visible delta so long Kimi reasoning phases no longer look like a dead blank bubble.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-14: fixed real OpenCode ACP permission requests so Web UI permission cards appear instead of silently dropping the tool call.
  - root cause: after the shared ACP CLI refactor, the OpenCode adapter never installed a `HandlePermissionRequest` hook, so any real `session/request_permission` call still hit the default `method not found` path. In addition, OpenCode can encode file-like permissions via `toolCall.locations[]` or `toolCall.rawInput.filepath` with generic titles such as `external_directory`.
  - extended the shared ACP permission parser to extract path-like previews from `locations[]` and `rawInput`, classify directory/path requests as `file`, and fall back to the resolved path when the provider title is too generic for the Web UI.
  - wired OpenCode into the same permission bridge as Kimi/Qwen and added regression coverage for real-style OpenCode `external_directory` payloads.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-14: converged direct ACP structured-permission bridging into one shared helper in `internal/agents/acpcli`.
  - Kimi, Qwen, and OpenCode previously carried identical provider-local `handlePermissionRequest` implementations even after sharing the same normalized permission-request parser.
  - moved that common bridge logic into `acpcli.StructuredPermissionRequestHandler(timeout)` and reduced each provider to a one-line hook binding plus its local timeout constant.
  - kept Gemini unchanged because it still uses a different provider-specific permission payload/response shape rather than the shared normalized `PermissionRequestPayload`.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-19: changed Web UI assistant rendering from one aggregated bubble into an event-ordered segment timeline.
  - root cause: the Web UI already persisted `reasoning_delta`, `tool_call`, and `tool_call_update`, but both live streaming and finalized history still rendered them as one concentrated reasoning/tool section plus one final assistant bubble, so the actual turn sequence was lost visually.
  - extended the frontend message model with ordered `segments`, rebuilt finalized assistant messages from persisted turn events (`message_delta`, `reasoning_delta`, `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`), and tracked the same segment timeline during SSE streaming.
  - tool-call updates now keep their original timeline position by merging later `tool_call_update` payloads into the first segment for that `toolCallId`, while message/reasoning deltas append new segments only when the stream actually switches modes.
  - kept plan cards as a separate block, but assistant content / thought / tool activity now render in the same chronological order the agent emitted them.
  - removed the IM-style left/right chat alignment for the transcript pane; user prompts now render as the top line of a single-column turn flow and agent output follows directly underneath in the same reading column.
  - during an in-flight turn, only the currently growing thought segment stays expanded; once a later answer/tool/plan event arrives, the completed thought segment immediately switches to the collapsed finalized-panel state instead of waiting for full turn completion.
  - completed answer segments now switch to finalized markdown rendering as soon as the stream moves on, so tables and other block markdown render immediately instead of staying as raw text until the whole turn finishes.
  - styled markdown tables in answer/thought blocks with borders, header background, zebra rows, and horizontal overflow so rendered tables are visually distinct instead of looking like loosely aligned text.
  - moved markdown tables onto a fit-content wrapper with independent horizontal scrolling, so the outer border now hugs the actual table content instead of stretching to the full transcript width.
  - changed tool-call segments from always-open cards into collapsible panels that follow the same interaction model as thought blocks: the currently updating tool call stays open during streaming, finalized tool calls default closed, and users can manually expand closed panels on demand.
  - kept permission-request cards outside that new fold/unfold treatment so approval prompts still remain independently visible and actionable while a turn is running.
  - delayed hidden tool-call detail `Show all` binding until the panel is actually opened, so nested command/JSON previews still compute their collapsed height correctly after the outer tool-call panel starts closed.
  - moved assistant copy actions from the whole-message footer down to each finalized answer segment, so clicking copy now copies only that visible answer block instead of concatenating every answer segment in the turn.
  - kept per-answer copy buttons under their own answer segments, but merged each segment's timestamp and copy control onto one small meta row so time appears first and copy follows on the same line.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-20: limited runtime agent handling to providers that actually pass startup preflight in the current environment.
  - root cause: ngent still used the full static provider list for `/v1/agents`, create-thread allowlist validation, and startup config-catalog refresh, so hosts that only installed a subset of agent CLIs emitted noisy `config_catalog.refresh_failed` warnings for missing binaries and exposed unusable agents in the frontend.
  - changed startup wiring to derive one active agent set from successful provider preflight checks and reuse that same set for frontend agent discovery, request validation, and config-catalog background refresh.
  - `GET /v1/agents` now omits unavailable providers instead of returning `status:"unavailable"`, and startup no longer attempts config/model refresh for agents whose binaries are absent in the running environment.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `env GOCACHE=/tmp/ngent-gocache GOFLAGS=-p=1 /usr/local/go/bin/go test ./...`

- 2026-03-21: deduplicated the built-in ACP provider `DiscoverModels` entrypoints.
  - `gemini`, `qwen`, `kimi`, and `opencode` all carried the same package-level wrapper that only called `New(cfg)` and then `client.DiscoverModels(ctx)`.
  - added `internal/agents/acpcli.DiscoverModelsWithClient` so that constructor-plus-delegate path lives in one shared helper.
  - updated `internal/agents/gemini/models.go`, `internal/agents/qwen/models.go`, `internal/agents/opencode/models.go`, and the ACP fallback in `internal/agents/kimi/models.go` to reuse that helper while preserving Kimi's local-config override behavior.
  - continued the same cleanup by moving the shared ACP `session/new`, `session/load`, `session/list`, and `sessionCWD` parameter builders into `internal/agents/acpcli`, then rewired `gemini`, `qwen`, `opencode`, and `kimi` to use those common helpers instead of carrying identical local functions.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-22: switched model/reasoning discovery from probe sessions to real session snapshots.
  - root cause: startup refresh plus `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` / `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/models` live fallbacks were still opening probe-only `session/new` calls, which created provider-owned empty sessions and could leak stale default config between unrelated threads.
  - removed startup config-catalog refresh from `cmd/ngent`, and changed the HTTP config/model read paths to return stored-only sqlite data instead of probing upstream runtimes.
  - added a shared config snapshot callback in `internal/agents`; user-initiated `session/new` / `session/load` responses from ACP stdio providers and embedded `codex` / `claude` now report their latest `configOptions` during `Stream()`, and session-history `session/load` can also feed the same persistence path.
  - the HTTP turn handler now persists those real snapshots immediately into sqlite:
    - `threads.agent_options_json` is updated with the session's actual current `modelId` / `configOverrides`
    - `agent_config_catalogs` is updated under the actual current model id for later reuse
  - switching a thread onto an existing session now clears stale thread-local model/reasoning selections first, so the next `session/load` becomes the source of truth for that session's current config.
  - the Web UI now hides model/reasoning controls until a real config snapshot exists, reloads config options after turns finish, and clears stale thread-local config cache on session switch.
  - updated HTTP tests to reflect the new lifecycle:
    - fresh threads expose empty `configOptions` until a real turn runs
    - stored config rows are only used when the thread already has a concrete `modelId`
    - agent model lists now come from stored sqlite catalogs only
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-22: persisted learned config snapshots per provider session so switching back to a known session restores model controls immediately.
  - root cause: after the earlier session-driven discovery change, real turns persisted config into thread state plus `agent_config_catalogs`, but a later session switch intentionally cleared thread-local `modelId` / `configOverrides`; switching back to that session then had no session-scoped snapshot to restore from.
  - added sqlite-backed `session_config_cache(agent_id, cwd, session_id, config_options_json, updated_at)` alongside transcript caching.
  - real turn config snapshots now write through both:
    - thread/agent-model state as before
    - session-scoped config cache keyed by `agent + cwd + sessionId`
  - when a fresh session reports config before `session_bound`, ngent now backfills the same snapshot into `session_config_cache` as soon as the session id is bound.
  - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` now restores from the current session cache when the thread points at a known `sessionId` but has no thread-local `modelId`.
  - user-triggered session switching now also learns config from `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/session-history`:
    - if transcript cache exists but session config cache is still missing, ngent performs one live `session/load` instead of stopping at cached transcript data
    - if that `session/load` returns `configOptions`, ngent persists them into thread state (when the thread is currently bound to that session), `agent_config_catalogs`, and `session_config_cache`
    - the Web UI refreshes config controls again after session-history replay finishes, so model/reasoning buttons can appear immediately after switching sessions without needing a new turn
  - additionally verified the session-load-only path with a fresh Codex thread on a fresh sqlite database:
    - created the thread without sending any turn
    - switched directly to an existing Codex session
    - confirmed `Model` and `Reasoning` buttons appeared immediately from that session's `session/load`
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `env GOCACHE=/tmp/ngent-gocache GOFLAGS=-p=1 /usr/local/go/bin/go test ./... -count=1`

- 2026-03-23: added Web UI attachment upload support that flows through ACP `resource_link` prompt content.
  - introduced a shared structured prompt model in the agent layer so HTTP turns can carry text plus ACP `resource_link` items instead of being limited to one plain string.
  - `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/turns` now accepts `multipart/form-data`; uploaded files are persisted into the local temp directory, converted into `file://` resource links, and preserved in history via a new `user_prompt` turn event.
  - ACP CLI and embedded providers now send structured `session/prompt` content arrays, while non-ACP/fallback streamers still receive a readable plain-text representation.
  - updated the Web UI composer to support attachment picking/removal, attachment-only sends, text+attachment sends, left-footer ordering `Attachment -> Model -> Reasoning`, and user-message attachment cards reconstructed from history.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./internal/httpapi ./internal/agents/...`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-24: wired ACP `session_info_update` titles through the turn stream into the Web UI session sidebar.
  - extended shared ACP `session/update` parsing with `session_info_update`, ignoring `title: null` while preserving non-null title changes keyed by `sessionId`.
  - added a turn-scoped session-info callback so HTTP streaming now emits `session_info_update` SSE/history events, and updated built-in ACP providers plus the shared stdio notification bridge to forward those updates.
  - the Web UI now applies live session-title updates to the matching sidebar session row and keeps a runtime override map so a slower follow-up `session/list` refresh does not immediately revert the new title.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./... -count=1`

- 2026-03-22: fixed the composer model/reasoning dropdowns so they remain clickable after session-history refresh updates them in place.
  - root cause: `bindThreadConfigSwitches()` can run more than once on the same composer DOM after a session switch; repeated `addEventListener('click', ...)` bindings caused one listener to open the menu and the next listener to close it immediately in the same click.
  - made config-switch binding idempotent per `.thread-model-switch` node, while still allowing later refresh passes to update labels, menu contents, and hidden/disabled state.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `env GOCACHE=/tmp/ngent-gocache GOFLAGS=-p=1 /usr/local/go/bin/go test ./... -count=1`

- 2026-03-22: fixed active-turn session switching when the current session had already persisted model/config state.
  - root cause: `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` intentionally allows session-only selection changes during an active turn, but the session-only detector compared the current thread options against the target options after the target session change had already stripped `modelId` / `configOverrides`; once the active session had learned config, that comparison incorrectly treated a pure session switch as a broader thread update and returned `thread has an active turn`.
  - `isSessionOnlyAgentOptionsUpdate()` now ignores thread-local config snapshot fields only when checking whether the change is a pure session/fresh-session selection change, while still rejecting unrelated active-turn thread edits such as direct model changes.
  - added HTTP regression coverage for switching away from an active session after its config snapshot has already been persisted.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `env GOCACHE=/tmp/ngent-gocache GOFLAGS=-p=1 /usr/local/go/bin/go test ./... -count=1`
    - pass: real browser validation with Kimi on `go run ./cmd/ngent -db-path /tmp/ngent-session-switch-active.db -port 8690 -debug`:
    - started a new Kimi session
    - triggered a long streaming response
    - switched to an older session while the turn was still active
    - confirmed the UI switched without the previous `thread has an active turn` alert

- 2026-03-22: kept active streaming sessions visible in the session sidebar after switching away.
  - root cause: the Web UI only inserted the currently selected session as an ephemeral row when it was missing from `session/list`; a newly created session that was still streaming but not yet present in the fetched session list disappeared from the sidebar as soon as the user switched to another session.
  - `renderSessionPanel()` now also prepends any thread-local session ids that are still active in `streamStates`, so running sessions stay visible until the real session list catches up.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `env GOCACHE=/tmp/ngent-gocache GOFLAGS=-p=1 /usr/local/go/bin/go test ./... -count=1`

- 2026-03-22: preserved exact provider permission options end-to-end instead of collapsing every request into `Allow` / `Deny`.
  - root cause: the Web UI hard-coded two buttons and `POST /v1/permissions/{permissionId}` only carried a generic outcome, so multi-option ACP permission requests from providers such as Kimi could not round-trip `allow once` / `allow always` / `reject once` / `reject always` exactly.
  - extended the shared permission model to keep provider `options[]` and an exact `SelectedOptionID`, and taught the ACP permission bridge to prefer that exact option id when replying to option-aware providers.
  - `permission_required` SSE payloads now include advertised permission options, `POST /v1/permissions/{permissionId}` now accepts `optionId` alongside the existing `outcome`, and the HTTP permission bridge infers the generic fallback outcome from the selected option kind when possible.
  - updated the Web UI permission card to render all advertised options dynamically, fall back to `Allow` / `Deny` only when no options are provided, and show the selected option label in the resolved state.
  - added regression coverage for exact option pass-through at the HTTP layer and for Kimi's structured permission handler preserving non-default selected option ids.
  - updated API / spec / frontend docs and acceptance criteria to describe dynamic permission options.

- 2026-03-26: moved uploaded Web UI attachments into the configurable data directory and made persisted attachment cards survive reload.
  - replaced the CLI storage root flag with `--data-path` (default `$HOME/.ngent/`), deriving sqlite as `data-path/ngent.db` instead of accepting a standalone `--db-path` file.
  - `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/turns` now persists uploads under `data-path/attachments/<category>/` rather than `/tmp`, using MIME/extension-aware categories such as `images`, `documents`, `text`, `audio`, `video`, `archives`, and `files`.
  - added sqlite-backed `turn_attachments(attachment_id, turn_id, name, mime_type, size, file_path, created_at)` and persist stable `attachmentId` values into `user_prompt` turn events.
  - added `GET /attachments/{attachmentId}` with client ownership checks and optional query-token auth so the Web UI can keep rendering persisted image/file cards after stream completion and history reload.
  - updated the Web UI history attachment reconstruction to build stable attachment URLs from `attachmentId`, show persisted previews/links after reload, and keep using in-memory `blob:` previews only for unsent/live local drafts.
  - updated README plus acceptance/decision/spec/known-issues docs to describe `--data-path`, durable attachment storage, and the remaining lack of an automatic attachment janitor.
  - executed validation:

    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-26: reduced Web UI session-switch stalls by making thread history session-scoped.
  - root cause: when the user selected one historical session, the Web UI still fetched `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/history?includeEvents=1` for the entire thread and then filtered it client-side, so a Codex thread with `21` turns and about `19 MB` / `42k` events could block the UI even though the target session only needed one turn.
  - added optional `sessionId` filtering to `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/history`; the server now applies the same legacy-session fallback rules as the Web UI (`session_bound` matching, include unannotated legacy turns only when the thread has exactly one annotated session, and continue hiding ephemeral cancelled placeholders).
  - updated the Web UI `loadHistory()` path to request `api.getHistory(threadId, requestedSessionID)` while keeping the existing local session filter as a compatibility fallback.
  - verified the real problematic Codex thread on a patched local server:
    - full thread history remained about `19.1 MB`
    - `Response.json()` time for the history payload dropped from about `120-133 ms` to about `2.5 ms`
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestThreadHistoryFiltersBySessionID -count=1`
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`

- 2026-03-26: removed the remaining session-switch jank on old high-delta history payloads.
  - residual issue: the first session-scoped fix still left old databases carrying every historical `message_delta` / `reasoning_delta` row in `/history`, so the browser could still do too much synchronous work while replaying one heavy session even though unrelated sessions were gone.
  - compacted consecutive same-turn history deltas server-side when serializing `/v1/threads/{threadId}/history?includeEvents=1`, covering `message_delta`, `reasoning_delta`, and `thought_delta` without changing persisted ordering across other event types.
  - kept the write-side storage merge in `AppendEvent(...)` so new data no longer accumulates redundant delta rows in the first place.
  - changed the Web UI message-list renderer to yield across animation frames for larger histories instead of rebuilding the whole chat synchronously in one pass.
  - real repro on the provided Codex session after both changes:
    - browser `Response.json()` for that history payload measured about `1.3 ms`
    - `hello -> first session` replay no longer showed a `>50 ms` main-thread gap; measured max RAF gap was about `9.4 ms` on the patched local server

- 2026-03-26: let the Web UI browse other sessions while one turn is still streaming.
  - root cause: the session sidebar treated "currently viewed session" and `thread.agentOptions.sessionId` as the same thing, so clicking another session during an active turn always tried `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` and surfaced `409 thread has an active turn`.
  - introduced a local per-thread session-selection override in the Web UI; when a thread already has an active stream, session switching now only changes the visible chat scope and history target instead of immediately patching backend thread state.
  - deferred backend `sessionId` sync until the active turn finishes, and also guard the send path by syncing any pending local selection before starting the next turn so new prompts still land in the session currently shown in the UI.
  - kept the existing fresh-session behavior by assigning stable local `@fresh:<nonce>` scopes, and cleaned those local overrides up when the thread is deleted.
  - executed validation:
    - pass: `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
    - pass: `go test ./...`
